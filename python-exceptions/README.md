n Exceptions

This project is about handling exceptions in Python and working with error handling.

## Description

The project is split into 7 tasks, each one focusing on different aspects of exception handling and error management in Python. The tasks range from safe printing of lists, to writing text to a file, to raising exceptions with error messages.

## Files & Directories

- `0-safe_print_list.py`: A function that prints x elements of a list.
- `1-safe_print_integer.py`: A function that prints an integer with "{:d}".format().
- `2-safe_print_list_integers.py`: A function that prints the first x elements of a list and only integers.
- `3-safe_print_division.py`: A function that divides 2 integers and prints the result.
- `4-list_division.py`: A function that divides element by element 2 lists.
- `5-raise_exception.py`: A function that raises a type exception.
- `6-raise_exception_msg.py`: A function that raises a name exception with a message.

## How to Use

Each Python script can be run on a Unix terminal. To make a script executable, use the command `chmod u+x file.py` replacing 'file.py' with the name of the file you want to make executable. Then you can run the script with `./file.py`.
