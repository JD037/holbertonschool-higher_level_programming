### Task 0: Squared simple

A function that computes the square value of all integers of a matrix.

- Prototype: `def square_matrix_simple(matrix=[])`
- `matrix` is a 2 dimensional array
- Returns a new matrix:
    - Same size as matrix
    - Each value should be the square of the value of the input
    - Initial matrix should not be modified
- Not allowed to import any module
- Allowed to use regular loops, map, etc.

File: `0-square_matrix_simple.py`
