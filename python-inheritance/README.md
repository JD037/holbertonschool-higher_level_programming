3. is_kind_of_class
Implemented a function that checks if an object is an instance of, or if the object is an instance of a class that inherited from, the specified class.

4. inherits_from
Implemented a function that checks if an object is an instance of a class that inherited (directly or indirectly) from the specified class.

5. BaseGeometry
Created an empty class BaseGeometry.

6. BaseGeometry (Improved)
Enhanced the class BaseGeometry with a public instance method area that raises an Exception.

7. Integer validator
Enhanced the class BaseGeometry by adding a method integer_validator that validates value.

8. Rectangle
Implemented a class Rectangle that inherits from BaseGeometry.
