General Info
In these projects, we explore the fundamentals of object-oriented programming in Python, including class definition, attribute and method creation, instantiation, and exception handling. We create a Square class and progressively add attributes and methods to this class in each task.

Tasks
Square class: An empty class Square that defines a square.

Square with size: The Square class now has a private instance attribute: size. We also create a public instance method area() that returns the current square area.

Size validation: The size attribute now has value validation. It must be an integer and greater than or equal to 0.

Area of a square: A new public instance method area() is added to the Square class, which returns the current square area.

Access and update private attribute: We define a property size(self) to retrieve the size attribute and a property setter size(self, value) to set it.

Printing the square: The Square class now has a public instance method my_print(self) that prints the square with the character #.

Coordinates of a square: The Square class now has a private instance attribute: position. We also define a property position(self) to retrieve it and a property setter position(self, value) to set it.
